# daq-systemtest

This repository contains configurations for system-level DAQ tests. Currently, there are two subdirectories:
* integtest: Pytest-based integration tests
* config: JSON configurations for `daqconf_multiru_gen` (and `daqconf_timing_gen`)

These tests are meant to be run as part of the release testing procedure to ensure that all of the functionality needed by DUNE-DAQ is present.

Version v1.0.0
